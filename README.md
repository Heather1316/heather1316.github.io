3. I created a repository with my name and some a few numbers behind it to create a valid repository. 
4. It was not hard at all to clone my repository. I downloaded the Desktop Github and there I was able to clone the repository. 

# About Me
I am a **46 Year Old** _Senior Service Manager_ at a Steakhouse in Knightdale, NC. I have worked at that restaurant for over ***16 years***. I was born and raised in _California_ where I started working in the _restaurant industry_ at 19. I moved to North Carolina when I was 26. I have two **_Beautiful_** Daughters. My _oldest_ daughter is 19, and my _youngest_ is 14. I have been married to my wonderful **husband** for _5 years_ but we have been together for _15_.
## My Interests
I love to ***cook***!! The kitchen _HAS_ to be my happy place. Even though I work at a restaurant _50_ hours out of my week, I still enjoy coming home and creating new dishes for my family to try. One of my favorite quotes about cooking is from _Thomas Keller_
>"_A recipe has no soul. you as the cook must bring soul to the recipe._"

If I am not in the kitchen or at work, I am attending _Wake Tech_ to get my _AAS_ in _CyberSecurity_. Computers have always been an interest of mine, and I am looking to further my education and explore another interests I have in life besides being in a restaurant. Things are very interesting since I have not been in a school setting since I graduated _high school_ in **1996**.
